# Performance Requirements

- Sustain 50+ TPS
- Maintain 60fps
- Use Virtual Scroll for tables
- Use OnPush everywhere
- No unnecessary re-computations

---

# Web Workers

Worker handles:
- ACH vs Card vs Wire breakdown totals
- Failure percentage calculation
- Heavy aggregation logic

Main thread handles rendering only.

---

# Resilience Strategy

- WebSocket auto reconnect
- Exponential backoff retry
- Circuit breaker on repeated API failures
- Graceful fallback UI
